"""
``csql.contrib`` contains some useful extensions, like alternative renderers
and cache implementations.

These may be directly useful, and additionally are a good starting point
if you want to write your own customizations.

.. warning::
	Things in ``contrib`` are not subject to the same promises of API stability
	as the rest of ``csql``. I won't go out of my way to make your life difficult,
	but at the same time I reserve the right to make more aggressive changes in here.
